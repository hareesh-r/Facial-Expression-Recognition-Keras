# Facial-Expression-Recognition-Keras
This is the Facial Expression Recognition Model built with TensorFlow , Keras , OpenCV in Python 3. The IDE used was Juypter Notebook hence the codes will be in the ipnb (i python note book) format . Uses Anaconda with Tensorflow enviorment as the backend. Used 8 layered Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
